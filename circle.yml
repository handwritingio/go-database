    # Because our internal imports are absolute (they include github.com), and
    # CircleCI doesn't place our code on the GOPATH correctly, we need to put it
    # there ourselves. If we didn't do this, `go get` would pull the code from
    # our master branch and use that in our tests, which isn't what we want!
